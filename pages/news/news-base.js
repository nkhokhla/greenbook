	fullText: `The fragmentation of natural habitats by fences and human settlements is threatening the survival of the white rhinoceros. 
	It prevents dispersal from the family group and leads to mating among close relatives. Additionally female rhinoceros favour individual 
	males for mating over others and sire several offspring with the same partner over consecutive breeding periods. These factors lead to a high degree of inbreeding. 
	The results come from the largest scientific study to date on the sexual preferences of white rhinos, published in the journal Evolutionary Applications. 
	The scientists propose specific measures to ensure the long term survival of the species.Understanding sexual behaviour and mate choice is important for optimising conservation efforts of white rhinos. 
	During the colonial period, intense hunting decimated white rhinos to a few individuals. All currently living white rhinos originate from this small founder population. 
	As a consequence, all white rhinos are depauperate in terms of their genetic diversity. The findings of this new scientific study suggest that the unusual mating behaviour of the white rhinos encourages the loss of genetic diversity. 
	"We need to keep the white rhinos as genetically diverse as possible, if we want to give them a chance to adapt to anthropogenic challenges such as poaching, climate change or diseases," explains Dr. Petra Kretzschmar, 
	the leading author of the study and a scientist at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (Leibniz-IZW). <br><br>

The scientists were surprised by their findings. They did not expect females to keep mating with the same male for several reproductive cycles because long-term bonds with mating partners were previously unknown for rhinos. 
"They live on their own and only get together shortly before mating," says Dr. Kretzschmar. 
"This is why it took us 13 years of field research to uncover the secrets of their mating behaviour," she continues. The combination of field data with the genetic analysis of paternity of 172 individuals identified three aspects
 of the mating behaviour of white rhinos that encourage the loss of genetic diversity. Many females stick to the same partner over several consecutive breeding periods, so all their offspring inherit genes from the same father. Moreover, rhinos do not avoid reproducing with family members, as known for many other species.<br><br> 
 Finally, the reproductive success of males is very unequal, so that a few males dominate the gene pool in the next generation.<br><br>

In the past, this mating behaviour was presumably not problematic because rhinos were able to leave the home ranges of their mothers and were thus not living near family members.
 "Today, all remaining rhinos live in modestly sized conservation areas and private game reserves surrounded by fences or human settlements. They cannot disperse far enough to avoid inbreeding," comments Dr. Alexandre Courtiol, senior author of the study.
 The researchers therefore recommend permanent monitoring of offspring and their genetic relatedness to rhinos nearby and a regular exchange of unrelated animals between protected areas. "This is the only way to preserve the long-term genetic heritage of the species," concludes Dr. Kretzschmar.  `,

	fullText: `Over three weeks starting Saturday, thousands of birders in the Western Hemisphere will take part in the annual, 119-year-old Audubon Christmas Bird Count. These tallies are conducted in prearranged circles within a seven-mile radius of a central point.
	 At least 30 such circles exist in Southern California, and counts in each are held during a planned 24-hour period, rain or shine.

Bird lovers will no doubt list California scrub jays and acorn woodpeckers, but they may also catch glimpses of rarer travelers, such as a palm warbler or a thick-billed kingbird that stayed to spend the winter.

The Christmas count is usually a welcome ritual for bird lovers and naturalists. This year, however, it will be something of a grim reckoning. In September, a team of scientists published an ambitious study of more than 500 North American bird species, painstakingly comparing counts over time.
 The results made headlines and shocked even experts: There are almost 3 billion fewer birds in North America than there were 50 years ago. Among the vanishing are some species—meadowlarks and finches, for instance—that used to be abundant. <br><br>

I have studied birds, taught about birds and written books about birds since the late 1970s in Southern California, and I've observed what those scientists documented: As we humans seize more and more wildlife habitat over time, the birds begin to disappear.

The Anthropocene—our era of human domination—has filled local lagoons with condo developments, polluted rivers and drained salt marshes. Freeways crisscross California's coastal sagebrush bluffs, and as for grasslands, they have disappeared from the foothills. Fire, often caused by human negligence, has ravaged the remaining pockets of coniferous forest in our mountains.

Where a bird lives, forages, nests and raises young is its home range, its habitat. When that habitat is destroyed or fractured, a species will fail to reproduce. It will leave or perish.

And yet the urgent problem of habitat loss can be remedied. <br><br>

At the San Joaquin Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary in Orange County, a former duck club is now a restored wetland within a stone's throw of high-rises and shopping malls. A rare shorebird turned up there in August—a common ringed plover. This tiny bird with a thick black breast band nests in Greenland and on Canadian Arctic islands; it usually heads to the west coast of Africa rather than landing in Orange County.

In the path of jumbo jets taking off from Los Angeles International Airport, where a development was razed to make way for runways, volunteers have restored sand dunes and coastal sage scrub. Last winter, 10 burrowing owls—a California "species of special concern"—were counted there, in a spot they haven't frequented in decades. The owls, along with the California gnatcatcher and the El Segundo blue butterfly, don't seem to mind the roar of the jet engines. In my home territory, Santa Barbara, there is a particularly spectacular example of what is possible. Now part of the UC Santa Barbara campus, a former golf course north of the university built on marsh upland has been carefully restored. More than 10 years ago, the Trust for Public Land purchased the then-decrepit Ocean Meadows course, which was handed over to the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration at the university. Fundraising went into high gear, partnerships were developed, scientists and planners weighed in, and so did the site's neighboring homeowners.

The chances for restoration were rich and varied: salt marsh, perennial grassland mesa and peripheral uplands closer to the condo developments. <br><br> Bulldozers widened a former creek bed and the restoration plan reconstituted the natural watershed. University students, citizens and schoolchildren gathered seed from native plants, nurtured the seedlings and then replanted the site. The 136-acre North Campus Open Space opened in 2018. Years ago, I and fellow birders used to stand wistfully at the margins of the old private golf course, looking through our binoculars to see what species remained after the marsh was disturbed. Last month, I strolled along a level path, surrounded by watery inlets and tall reeds, watching ducks and shorebirds feed. On a distant hillside, a burrowing owl had already claimed one of the "hibernacula," a manmade burrow. Western meadowlarks were visiting the newly planted grassland portion. One birder, posting on the North Campus Open Space eBird list, tallied 46 species in just over two hours earlier this month.

The North Campus restoration is the Anthropocene at its best: humans mitigating our own destructive impact in grand style. But even a more minimal effort—a pocket park in an urban center, a small plot of restored shoreline plants—can yield a big payoff for wildlife, not to mention people. And of course, the best solution for the problem of disappearing birds is not to destroy their precious habitat in the first place. <br><br>

As development squeezes out nature, we are all the losers. Save the birds and you are saving our natural world. It's not too late. `,

	name: "Florida's black bears remain off-limits from hunters, but only for now",

	fullText: `The Florida black bear will remain off-limits from hunters, but only for now.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission on Wednesday approved a 10-year management plan and decided there was no need to schedule a hunt to control the growing population of bears in the wild.

But despite intense pressure from conservation groups, animal advocates and others, commissioners also refused to remove hunting as a method of population control, leaving the door open for future hunts. More than 50 speakers objected to the hunt, while a handful of others, mostly hunters, defended the practice.

The FWC estimates there are about 4,000 black bears in Florida, a 50% increase from 2002. <br><br> In 1974, when the black bear was declared a threatened species, there were just about 300 animals.

"We are listening very carefully, and we are trying to take a thoughtful approach to this," said FWC Chairman Robert Spottswood. "We are not prepared to go forward with consideration of a hunt today, but we may in the future." He said the agency will manage bears from a conservation perspective.

After facing backlash following 2015 black bear hunt when more than 300 animals were killed in just two days, the FWC is trying to take a more data-driven approach to controlling the bears. Commissioners talked about science and conservation and pledged to consider non-lethal population management tools to reduce human-bear conflicts. The hunt four years ago was the first in 21 years, and was hastily organized in response to a spate of maulings, three of them in Orlando suburbs.

Conservationists said at the time that the commission, appointed by former Gov. Rick Scott, overwhelmingly represented property developers resistant to preserving bear habitat. <br><br>

Scheduled to last a week, the 2015 hunt was canceled after just 48 hours when harvest limits were quickly surpassed. A total of 304 bears were killed, mostly in the central region of the state and in the Panhandle. Public outrage exploded when news emerged that almost 40 lactating females were killed, leaving as many as 100 cubs to starve and die, and that baits were illegally used to attract bears into firing range. A few cubs weighing little over 40 pounds were also shot.

During the meeting on Wednesday the FWC staff, commissioners and most speakers acknowledged that Florida's booming population of more than 21 million people create challenges for bear management. Booming area like the Orlando suburbs for example, were once prowled by black bears and human-bear interactions are increasing, said David Telesco, who leads FWC's bear management program.

"Most of the calls we receive about bears have to do with bears trying to get to people's garbage; bears in the yard trying to get to the trash, bear climbing a tree to get to the garbage, or wandering around a gated community looking for food in people's garbage. That's the main issue," Telesco said, adding that calls that are classified as general sightings often involve a bear that's looking for food in deer feeders. <br><br>

The FWC has launched education programs like BearWise to help communities limit conflicts. <br><br>

One major problem is that development has sharply reduced natural food supplies like saw palmetto berries. That has pushed Florida's largest mammal out of forests and into residential areas, where they can easily find trash and are more vulnerable to being hit by cars. Vehicle collisions is the first cause of bear mortality in Florida, and roadkill numbers have steadily increased. The FWC recorded 241 deaths in 2018 compared with 245 in the previous year and 109 in 2000.

Creating more protected areas and wildlife corridors where bears can live and forage for food in peace is crucial, said Elizabeth Fleming, Florida representative for Defenders of Wildlife. Black bears, which historically inhabited the entire state, are now disconnected by development and wildlife corridors are needed to help improve genetic diversity, according to FWC's management plan.

"Most of the focus has been on the hunting issue but we need to look at other measures to protect habitat and teach people not to attract bears to urban areas," she said. "People feed bears rotisserie chicken! As long as that kind of thing is happening, managing bears will remain a challenge." `,
